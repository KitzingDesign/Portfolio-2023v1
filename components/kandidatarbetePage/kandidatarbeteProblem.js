            <p>
              To understand the work situation of the Sm채ltare, various data
              collection methods were employed and subsequently analyzed. These
              methods included a digital walkthrough, a pilot interview with a
              shift leader who had previously been a Sm채ltare, market analysis,
              literature reviews on workplace ergonomics, and five detailed
              interviews with current Sm채ltare. The collected data was analyzed,
              and a requirement specification was then created. Below, four of
              the most important components are presented.
